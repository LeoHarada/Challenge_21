# Challenge_21

# Background
After waiting for years and passing several tests, I was selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be a part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, I was chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. I have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. I will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
